## Getting Started

### About
Pyperch is a neural network weight optimization package developed to support students taking Georgia Techâ€™s graduate machine learning course CS7641. 
Three random optimization algorithms - randomized hill climbing, simulated annealing, and a genetic algorithm - can be used as drop-in replacements for traditional gradient-based optimizers using PyTorch.
### Install

```
pip install pyperch
```
